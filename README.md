# ClockConverter
 A 30 minute program that gives you total number of hours based on hours and minutes given

# The Reason
 I made this program because I was tired of converting minutes to hours while adding up the time I spent studying various things by hand or calculator
 It took 30 minutes to do. 

# Update
 All you have to do is add up you total hours and minutes and it converts it into an accurate amount of time spent. 
 So there is some manual labor (for example, I might study 2 hr and 24 m on Monday and 3 hr and 15 m on Tuesday) so I have to add those minutes on my own
 But I don't have to convert them with this program. 
 I can also do something like 2hr and 90m and it turns it into 3:30 for example
 
 # Update 04062024
 Added printf formating to the minutesLeftOver variable
 Now the clock will do 14:04 instead of 14:4 if you were to do something like 12 hours and 124 minutes

 # Update 05012024
 Added seconds feature (Can replace the secondsToMinutes and minutesToHour functions with a single function that uses both of them)
 Also made a while loop so you can put in as many hours, minutes, and seconds as you like without having to add them up in your head.
